== Building Block View

This diagram represents the main abstract structure of the application.

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image:05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

=== Whitebox Overall System  (Level 1)

===== Motivation

This shows a basic structure of the system application. The locations uf the users are stored on their own PODs, only the essential information is stored on the application.


===== Contained Building Blocks
|=========================================================
| **Name** | **Responsibility**

| Radarin
| The Application that the user interacts with. This represents the whole estructure of the main product.

| POD
| Data stored securely with the purpouse of creating a value to the user. This is needed to implement the Solid principles. 

|=========================================================


=== Level 2

===== Motivation
 
This level represents the basic view of the application, in other words, the esential components of the application.

===== Contained Building Blocks

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| App | Set of the diferents modules used on the development of the application.
| Modules | Stands for the npm modules installed in the project and our dependencies to them.
|===


=== Level 3

==== App

===== Motivation

Representation of the main blocks of the application for structuring the diferent parts of it. All of them are used in diferent objectives, every one of them will specialize in one part of the core application.

===== Contained Building Blocks

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| Internationalization | This will make the application more friendly with different kind of users.
| Controllers | This will communicate the user with the application.
| Services | This will controll the logic of the aplication.
| Entities | This will be the classes generated to give persistency to the application.

Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

_**<Overview Diagram>**_

Motivation::

_<text explanation>_


Contained Building Blocks::
_<Description of contained building block (black boxes)>_

Important Interfaces::
_<Description of important interfaces>_

[role="arc42help"]
****
Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.
****


==== <Name black box 1>

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe <black box 1>
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

****

_<Purpose/Responsibility>_

_<Interface(s)>_

_<(Optional) Quality/Performance Characteristics>_

_<(Optional) Directory/File Location>_

_<(Optional) Fulfilled Requirements>_

_<(optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks>_




==== <Name black box 2>

_<black box template>_

==== <Name black box n>

_<black box template>_


==== <Name interface 1>

...

==== <Name interface m>



=== Level 2

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

==== White Box _<building block 1>_

[role="arc42help"]
****
...describes the internal structure of _building block 1_.

_<white box template>_

==== White Box _<building block 2>_


_<white box template>_

...

==== White Box _<building block m>_


_<white box template>_



=== Level 3

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
part of arc42 for additional levels.
