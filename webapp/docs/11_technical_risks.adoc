== Risks and Technical Debts





.Risks Table
|=========================================================
| Risk | Explanation | Solution 


| SOLID
| We have never used SOLID before, so we dont have any kind of knowledge about it.
| We can read the available documentation and ask for help to more veteran developers in this matter.

| POD
| The fact that this is a very new technology makes it hard to know something about it.
| The only solution is to give it a try and use it by creating one and making different scenarios/tests with it. One very basic solution would be creating a contacts agenda with it.

| REACT
| In our team there is no one that knows about React. But we have previous knowledge about Js wich makes it easier to learn about it.
| Trial and Error. We will have to explore the technology by directly using it to develop this application.

| Docker
| We dont need to know very much about it because is more important to focus our work into the other materials. Nevertheless we think is important to establish the very basics anyway.
| We need to learn the basic commands and operations of this platform to properly work with it.

| Git
| We have some flaws with the basic command knowledge.
| This is not a major problem because we have a lot of documentation of how to use git, also we have previous knowledge acquired throughout the past years.
