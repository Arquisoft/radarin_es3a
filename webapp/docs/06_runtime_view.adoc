== Runtime View


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...

=== <Sign up>

Any person can sign up in the application via the log in screen. Signing up comences upon touching the "Sign up" button.

1. The user touches the "sign up" button.
2. The user selects a valid pod.
3. The user enters credentials, such as an email, a non-registrated username, and a valid password; and touches the sign up button.
4. The application registers said user in its database.

actor User
database Pod
User -> Radarin: Touches sign up button
User -> Radarin: Selects Pod
User -> Radarin: Enters credentials
Radarin -> Pod: Requests registration
Pod -> Radarin: Accepts registration
Radarin -> User: Grants access to functionality

****

=== <Log in>

A potential user may log in the application via the log in screen. Log in comences upon entering the application.

1. The user enters their credentials, such as their username and password.
2. The user touches the log in button.
3. The application, if the log in is valid, returns the functionality of the application.

actor User
database Pod
User -> Radarin: Enters credentials
User -> Radarin: Touches log in button
Radarin -> Pod: Log in request
Pod -> Radarin: Log in response
Radarin -> User: Shows content

=== <Register friends>

1. The user touches the "add a friend" button.
2. The user enters said friend's WebID.
3. The application sends a petition to the associated Pod.
4. Said Pod sends back a confirmation.
5. The user is shown the new friend in their friends list.

actor User
database FriendPod
User -> Radarin: Touches the add a friend button
User -> Radarin: Enters a friend's WebID
Radarin -> FriendPod: Sends petition
FriendPod -> Radarin: Sends confirmation
Radarin -> User: Shows updated friend list

=== <Geolocate friends>

1. The user access the application.
2. The application request the localization of added friends in the friend list.
3. Connected friends send back the localization.
4. The application shows the user a map with the localization of said friends.

actor User
database FriendsPods
User -> Radarin: Access application
Radarin -> FriendsPods: Request localization
FriendsPods -> Radarin: Provides localization
Radarin -> User: Shows friends location

It is possible to use a sequence diagram:

[plantuml,"Sequence diagram",png]
----
actor Alice
actor Bob
database Pod as "Bob's Pod"
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
Alice  --> Pod: Store route
Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
